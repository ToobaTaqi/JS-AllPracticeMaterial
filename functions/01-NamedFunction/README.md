### Basic Exercises

1. **Simple Function Declaration**
   - Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

2. **Function Expressions**
   - Create a function expression that multiplies two numbers and returns the result.

3. **Arrow Functions**
   - Convert the above function expression to an arrow function.

4. **Default Parameters**
   - Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product. If the second parameter is not provided, it should default to 1.

5. **Return Values**
   - Write a function that takes a string and returns the string reversed.

### Intermediate Exercises

6. **Higher-Order Functions**
   - Write a function that takes another function and a number as parameters. It should call the provided function the specified number of times.

7. **Callback Functions**
   - Write a function that takes a callback function and an array. It should apply the callback function to each element of the array and return the new array.

8. **Closures**
   - Write a function that returns another function. The returned function should maintain access to a variable from the outer functionâ€™s scope.

9. **Recursion**
   - Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

10. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)**
    - Create an IIFE that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Advanced Exercises

11. **Function Composition**
    - Write a function that takes two functions and returns a new function that is the composition of the two (the output of the first function is the input of the second).

12. **Currying**
    - Write a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Then, convert this function to a curried version.

13. **Partial Application**
    - Write a function that partially applies another function. For example, create a function that adds a fixed number to any given number.

14. **Memoization**
    - Write a function that caches the results of previous calls to improve performance. Apply this to a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

15. **Debouncing**
    - Write a debounce function that delays the execution of a provided function until after a specified time has elapsed since the last time it was called.

### Expert-Level Exercises

16. **Throttling**
    - Write a throttle function that ensures a provided function is only called at most once within a specified time period.

17. **Error Handling in Asynchronous Functions**
    - Write an asynchronous function that fetches data from an API. Include proper error handling for network errors and invalid responses.

18. **Custom Promise Implementation**
    - Implement a simplified version of JavaScript's Promise object to understand its inner workings.

19. **Function Generators**
    - Write a generator function that yields an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers.

20. **Async/Await with Error Handling**
    - Write an async function that fetches data from multiple APIs sequentially, handling errors at each step and ensuring all steps are completed before proceeding.
